# Regression Analysis and Types of Regression

## Overview
Regression analysis is a fundamental statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is widely used in data science, machine learning, and statistical analysis for prediction and inference.

This repository provides an overview of regression analysis, focusing on the main types of regression models and their implementations in Python.

## Main Types of Regression
### 1. **Linear Regression**
   - 📈 Models the relationship between variables using a straight line.
   - ✏️ Formula: `Y = β0 + β1X + ε`
   - 🔍 Used for predicting continuous values.

### 2. **Multiple Linear Regression**
   - ➕ An extension of linear regression with multiple independent variables.
   - ✏️ Formula: `Y = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + ... + βnXn + ε`

### 3. **Logistic Regression**
   - 🎯 Used for binary classification problems.
   - 📊 Outputs probabilities and applies a sigmoid function to predict class labels.

## Installation
To run the regression models in this repository, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
Examples of different regression models are provided in the `notebooks/` directory. You can run them using Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
